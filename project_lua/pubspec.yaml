# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

    - assets/lua/component/my_stateless_widget.lua

    - assets/lua/page/test_pageview.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_stf.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_listview.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_listview_builder.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_listview_custom.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_listview_sp.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_gridview.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_helper.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_safearea.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_ani.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_positioned.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_share_preferences.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_consumer.lua
    - assets/lua/page/test_bottomnavigationbar.lua

    - assets/img/R-C.jfif

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: ResourceHanRoundedCN
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/ResourceHanRoundedCN-Medium.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
